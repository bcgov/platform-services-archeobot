# Archeobot

Archeobot is an operator which provisions Artifactory resources and service elements. It currently provisions service accounts, with private repositories to be added very soon.

Currently, Archeobot lives alongside Artifactory in `devops-artifactory` on the Silver cluster, but will soon live in its own (to be named) namespace on every cluster!

## Contact Info

Support for Artifactory and the Archeobot is provided primarily through the `#artifactory` [Rocket.Chat](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca) channel!
