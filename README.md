![Lifecycle:Maturing](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Maturing-007EC6)

Archeobot is an operator which provisions Artifactory resources and service elements. It currently provisions service accounts, with private repositories to be added very soon.

Currently, Archeobot lives in `devops-archeobot` on the Silver cluster. A second operator will be rolled out to Gold soon as well!

## Contact Info

Support for Artifactory and the Archeobot is provided primarily through the `#artifactory` [Rocket.Chat](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca) channel!
